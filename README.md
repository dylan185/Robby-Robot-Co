Robby Robot Co.

This project is to create a working program that will allow customers to build, select, and order from different models of robots. 
It also lets the customer check the status of their order, and see the price.
It also lets the sales representitive create new orders, check their own sales and even make bulk orders if necesary. 
The boss can also go in and check total sales and figure out which models are most popular. 

Our goal is to make a GUI for this program that will allow a point and click envirorment and provide a more friendly
experience for customers.
